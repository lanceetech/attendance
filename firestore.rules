/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a combination of user-ownership and role-based access control.
 *  - Users can only read and write their own user documents.
 *  - Public read access is granted to units, classes, classrooms, feedback, and timetable data.
 *  - Writes to units, classes, classrooms, feedback, and timetable data are currently open but MUST be secured later with role-based or ownership checks.
 * @data_structure
 *  - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 *  - /units/{unitId}: Stores information about course units.
 *  - /classes/{classId}: Stores information about scheduled classes.
 *  - /classes/{classId}/attendance/{attendanceId}: Stores attendance records for a class.
 *  - /classrooms/{roomId}: Stores information about classrooms.
 *  - /feedback/{feedbackId}: Stores user feedback.
 *  - /studentTimetable/{entryId}: Stores student timetable data.
 *  - /lecturerTimetable/{entryId}: Stores lecturer timetable data.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *  - User listing is denied to prevent information harvesting.
 *  - Public read access is granted to certain collections for ease of use in this prototype, but write access is not fully secured and requires further refinement.
 *  - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
