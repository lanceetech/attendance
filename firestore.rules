/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with some owner-based restrictions.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with the document ID being the user's UID.
 * - /units/{unitId}: Stores information about course units.
 * - /classes/{classId}: Stores scheduled class sessions.
 * - /classes/{classId}/attendance/{attendanceId}: Subcollection for attendance records.
 * - /classrooms/{roomId}: Stores information about classrooms.
 * - /feedback/{feedbackId}: Stores user feedback.
 * - /studentTimetable/{entryId}: Stores timetable entries for students.
 * - /lecturerTimetable/{entryId}: Stores timetable entries for lecturers.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is denied.
 * - Only authenticated users can submit feedback.
 * - Timetable data for students and lecturers is publicly readable.
 * - There is no data validation in place in this prototype version.
