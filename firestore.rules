/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ClassSync.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a multi-layered security model with path-based ownership for user-specific data,
 * membership-based access for collaborative data, and role-based access for administrative functions. Data
 * access is strictly controlled to ensure that users can only access data they own, are explicitly permitted
 * to access through a membership map, or that is explicitly public. The absence of custom claims and the
 * denormalization of authorization data are central to simplifying security rules and improving performance.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data. Access is restricted to the user themselves.
 * - /units/{unitId}: Stores unit data. Access is open for reads. Writes are not explicitly secured and requires a ownership field (e.g. `authorId`)
 * - /lecturers/{lecturerId}: Stores lecturer data. Access is open for reads. Writes are not explicitly secured and requires a ownership field (e.g. `authorId`)
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student data. Access is open for reads. Writes are not explicitly secured and requires a ownership field (e.g. `authorId`)
 * - /classes/{classId}: Stores class data. Access is open for reads. Writes are not explicitly secured and requires a ownership field (e.g. `authorId`)
 * - /rooms/{roomId}: Stores room data. Access is open for reads. Writes are not explicitly secured and requires a ownership field (e.g. `authorId`)
 * - /attendances/{attendanceId}: Stores attendance data. Access is open for reads. Writes are not explicitly secured and requires a ownership field (e.g. `authorId`)
 * - /feedback/{feedbackId}: Stores user feedback. Access is open for reads. Writes are not explicitly secured and requires a ownership field (e.g. `authorId`)
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Presence of a document indicates admin role for the given user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict user-ownership model for user profiles under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Read operations are generally open unless the data is user-specific private data.
 * - Write operations are not open and require a ownership field to be present on the document and an owner validation is added, this is critical.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - No external lookups are used for authorization. All necessary data is present in the documents being secured.
